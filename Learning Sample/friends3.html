Passing the onClick a reference to a function so that react can decide when to call the function.


//Functional component (stateless) is used to recieve props (data) and then just render the UI, just use react function

//Whenever you need state you need to use a CLASS (component to manage its own state) 

//When state needs to be shared, bring the state to the highest shared parent, then pass it down as props to all children in order to be managed.

//Using bind allows you to specify what the this keyword refers to. We want this to refer to the App component, so we bind it to this inside the app component(constructor)

//Use setState in component to change manage state in a component
